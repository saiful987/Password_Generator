# Password_Generator

Description:

The whole reasoning behind this assignment is to create a password generator that will be creating random characters for the user. The user gets to pick the length of the password (8-128). The password generator will be generating upper case letters, lower case letters, special characters, and numbers. After that, the user gets to pick whether or not if they want the upper case letters, lower case letters, or special characters added to their password or not. once that's decided, the password generator will create a random password using the user input that was provided.
